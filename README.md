## Project analysis

### Target user porfile

The final user for this curriculum vitae is a company that needs a web developer, computer scientist, or app developer.
It's expected to find the skills of who could work in the company, and evaluate if could be hired depending on the company needings.

### Information architecture

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This is a single-page web so this section isn't so important. But basically consists of three parts differentiated from each other by the colors and the information they contain


### Visual design
* Colors

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I basicaly used a palette of greenish gray tones and pinks. 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Distributed in darker shades of gray for the header to give consistency, lighter for the central part where there are information about the skills because of the logos of the languages already have enough color to stand out by themselves. And in the supplementary information i used a pale pink shade.

* Typography 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For the typography i used black and white colors, and the default font style.

* Page structure

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The basic structure of the curriculum is a header with the photo, name, and contact. Then the content is divided into two parts, the larger one is specified into a grid where there are the different skills that may be of interest, where are the logo, name, and degree of knowledge. 
Finally, on the right side of the page, there is a kind of timeline with the studies completed, the level of languages known, and some projects created that can be useful to see the way of work.
